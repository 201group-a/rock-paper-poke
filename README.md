A Pokemon Themed Rock Paper Scissors game using 5 objects

## User Stories

### Bob And Friends

Bob and his friends are out at dinner one night. They can not decide who will pay for the bill so they open up rock paper poke and determine who is going to pay for dinner. Users can pick which pokemon they would like to battle with and the rules of the elements will determine the winner. If 5 or less people are at the dinner then they could all pick a type and base it off of just one game. Two people may have to split the check though as 2 types will lose to each type and 2 types will win against each type!

### John And Lucy

John and his wife Lucy both want to buy a new car but they can only afford one at the moment. They can not decide who will get this new car in a fair manor. They will each pick a pokemon on rock paper poke to determine this. If John wins and Lucy loses, John gets a new car. If Lucy wins and John loses, Lucy gets a new car. If neither wins or both wins, they will save up until they can both get a new car!

## Software Requirements

The vision of this project is to create a Pokemon-themed rock, paper, scissors game that allows the user to select their character to go up against a randomly selected character. The game can be for entertainment or to make decisions based on the outcome of the game like you would with traditional rock, paper, scissors. It's a fun engaging game.

### Scope:

In:

- Users can choose their character out of five choices.
- Three rounds of the game will be played.
- Winning and losing stats will be stored on a separate page.

Out:

- The game will not make life-changing decisions, it's for fun.
- The game will be an IOS or Android App.
- The web application will not be connected to a database.

### MVP:

Create an interactive rock, paper, scissors, game that engages the user through the user's choice of Pokemon and plays it against randomly selected opposing pokemon.  The user's wins and losses will be stored locally. The web application will contain a minimum of four web pages.

### Stretch Goals:

- Expanding the variety of Pokemon for each type.
- Displaying all viewed Pokemon on local storage.
